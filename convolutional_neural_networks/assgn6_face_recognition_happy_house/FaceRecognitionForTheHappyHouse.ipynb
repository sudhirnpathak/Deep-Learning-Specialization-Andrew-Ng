    "# Face Recognition for the Happy House\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Face Verification** - \"is this the claimed person?\". For example, at some airports, we can pass through customs by letting a system scan our passport and then verifying that we (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using our face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. \n",
    "- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem, as we have to match face of one person against K employees to find if he/she is one of the employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, we can then determine if two pictures are of the same person. In this notebook, we first implement the triplet loss function, then use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings. We use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will be using a pre-trained model which represents ConvNet activations using a \"channels first\" convention, as opposed to the \"channels last\". In other words, a batch of images will be of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W)$ instead of $(m, n_H, n_W, n_C)$. Both of these conventions have a reasonable amount of traction among open-source implementations; there isn't a uniform standard yet within the deep learning community. \n",
